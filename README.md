# String-Theory

This repository contains homework assignments from the second semester of a string theory course taught in the spring of 2020 at Stony Brook University by 
Peter Van Nieuwenhuizen, Martin Rocek, and Warren Siegel. 

HWx.pdf files contain my typeset solutions. Not all assignments were typeset, so some are missing. StringS20_HW0x.pdf files contain the questions for the first four assignments; the rest were unavailable at the time of this repository's creation.
